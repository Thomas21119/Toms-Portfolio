            </h3>   
            <p class="websiteDescription"> Flight Finder is the first website i worked on in a calaborative environment. Coming up with an idea from Scratch. We decided to use API's to find flights
                to various places around the world from any given city as well as convert currencies, find places of interest and calculate group costs

            <p class="websiteDescription">Weather Outlook by city was my first time working with API's and i was lucky enough to be given a reliable one to work with, finding weather at current and future dates
                for any given city around the world.

            </h3>   
            <p class="websiteDescription">I found the Password-Generator to be particularly challenging at first attempt, working with new javaScript code and it was all incredibly intriguing
                especially the randomise function

            <p class="websiteDescription">Css-Snippets Is The first website i made from scratch, learning how to create many different styles and effects through Css.  
                Obviously as a newcomer it's quite the basic site with some links and references for me to come back too if i need to refer back to some of my earlier Work

            </h3>   
            <p class="websiteDescription">Though I didn't make Horiseon from scratch this is the other complete website I have worked on. Whilst working on it I 
                debugged some code to make sure all links worked properly and cleaned up the code as there was lots of repeating and unnecesary code, as well as lots of repeat values instead of variables.
