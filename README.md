# Toms-Portfolio
This is my first attempt of a portfolio, something i'm planning on updating and creating more of as i improve as a programmer, adding more css, java-script and most importantly create more websites. I have a my-work section to show off what i've created so far with some placeholders as unfortunately im yet to make much. A short about me section to try describe who i am to potential clients. Lastly my contact information so those same clients can contact me. The Website is designed to function at 600 pixels of width and above.
